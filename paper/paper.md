# Summary

`linopy` is an open-source package written in Python to facilitate linear and mixed-integer optimization with n-dimensional labeled input data. Using state-of-the-art data analysis packages, `linopy` enables a high-level algebraic syntax and memory-efficient, performant communication with open and proprietary solvers. While similar packages use object-oriented implementations of single variables and constraints, `linopy` stores and processes its data in an array-based data model. This allows the user to build large optimization models quickly in parallel and lays the foundation for features such as fast writing to NetCDF file, masking, solving on remote servers, and model scaling.

# Statement of need

Mathematical programming and optimization is a broad field in the research community. There exists a list of open-source and proprietary solvers such as `GLPK` [@GLPKGNUProject], `Gurobi` [@GurobiFastestSolver], `Xpress` [@FICOXpressSolver], each with its own strengths and weaknesses. To ensure comparability and re-usability for a wide range of users, many research projects dealing with optimization aim to make their work compatibles with many solvers as possible.
Besides the solver specific interfaces like `Gurobipy` [@GurobipyPythonInterface] and others, there is therefore the general need for a solver-independent interface allowing the user to formulate optimization problems and solve it with the solver of choice.

Fulfilling this need, Algebraic modeling languages (AML) allow to formulate large scale, complex problems using a high-level syntax similar to the mathematical notation. Well established AMLs such as GAMS[@gamsdevelopmentcorporationGAMSCuttingEdge] and AMPL [@amploptimizationinc.AMPLStramlinedModeling,@fourerAMPLModelingLanguage2003] support a wide range of solvers, but are license-restricted and rely on closed-source code. In contrast, AMLs as JuMP[@dunningJuMPModelingLanguage2017], Pyomo [@hartPyomoOptimizationModeling2017], GEKKO [@bealGEKKOOptimizationSuite2018] and PuLP [@Pulp2022] are open-source and have gained increasing attention throughout the recent years. While the Julia package JuMP is characterized by high-performance in-memory communication with the solvers, the Python packages Pyomo, GEKKO and PuLP lack parallelized, low-level operations and communicate slower with the solver via intermediate files written to disk. Further, the Python AMLs do not make use of state-of-the-art data handling packages. In particular, the assignment of coordinates or indexes is often not supported or memory extensive due to use of an object-oriented implementation where every single combination of coordinates is stored separately.

`linopy` tackles these issues together. By introducing an array-based data model for variables and constraints, it makes mathematical programming compatible with Python's advanced data handling packages Numpy[@harrisArrayProgrammingNumPy2020], Pandas [@rebackPandasdevPandasPandas2022] and Xarray [@hoyerXarrayNDLabeled2017] while significantly increasing speed and flexibility.

# Basic Structure

The core data classes `Variable`, `LinearExpression` and `Constraint`  are subclasses of `xarray`'s `DataArray` and `Dataset` class. These contain n-dimensional arrays with unique labels referencing the optimization variables and coefficients. Hence, variables and constraints  are defined together with a set of dimensions and their corresponding coordinates.
For example, creating a variable $x(d_1, d_2)$ defined on $d_1 \in \{1,...,N\}$ and $d_2 \in \{1,...,M\}$, would only require passing $d_1$ and $d_2$ to the variable initialization, with optional lower and upper bounds $l_x(d_1,d_2)$ and $u_x(d_1,d_2)$ being defined on (a subset of) $\{d_1, d_2\}$. The returned object is an $N \times M$ array of integer labels referencing to the optimization variables used by the solver.

# Benchmark

Benchmarking against two well-established open source AMLs Gurobi and Pyomo, `linopy` outperforms Pyomo in speed and memory-efficieny and outperform JuMP in memory-efficiency.
