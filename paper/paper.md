# Summary

linopy is an open-source Python package that facilitates linear and mixed-integer optimization with n-dimensional, labeled input data. It uses state-of-the-art data analysis tools to enable a high-level algebraic syntax and a memory-efficient, performant communication with open and proprietary solvers. With

# Statement of need

# Convention

# Related Research

`linopy` is used by several research projects and groups. The [PyPSA package](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa) [@brownPyPSAPythonPower2018] is an open-source software for (large scale) energy system modelling and optimization. Together with the [PyPSA-Eur workflow](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur) [@horschPyPSAEurOpenOptimisation2018] and the sector-coupled extension [PyPSA-Eur-sec](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur-sec) [@brownPyPSAPythonPower2018], it uses `linopy` to solve large linear problems with up to $10^8$ variables.
