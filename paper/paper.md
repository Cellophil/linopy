# Summary

Linopy is an open-source package written in Python to facilitate linear and mixed-integer optimization with n-dimensional labeled input data. Using state-of-the-art data analysis packages, Linopy enables a high-level algebraic syntax and memory-efficient, performant communication with open and proprietary solvers. While similar packages use object-oriented implementations of single variables and constraints, Linopy stores and processes its data in an array-based data model. This allows the user to build large optimization models quickly in parallel and lays the foundation for features such as fast writing to NetCDF file, masking, solving on remote servers, and model scaling.

# Statement of need

Many research groups and companies in business and industry rely on mathematical programming, i.e. optimization. Typically, a mathematical program consists of one objective function to be numerically minimized and a set of constraints that subject the underlying variables to external conditions. Algebraic Modeling Languages (AML) aim at facilitating mathematical programming by allowing the user to formulate large scale, complex problems with a high-level syntax similar to the mathematical notation. The formulated problem is then passed to the solver of choice where the solution is calculated. In this way, AMLs provide the most user-friendly interface possible to various solvers, each with its own set of features.

Well established AMLs such as GAMS [@gamsdevelopmentcorporationGeneralAlgebraicModeling] and AMPL [@fourerModelingLanguageMathematical1990] support a wide range of solvers, but are license-restricted and rely on closed-source code. In contrast, AMLs as JuMP [@dunningJuMPModelingLanguage2017], Pyomo [@hartPyomoOptimizationModeling2017], GEKKO [@bealGEKKOOptimizationSuite2018] and [PuLP](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp) are open-source and have gained increasing attention throughout the recent years. While the Julia package JuMP is characterized by high-performance, in-memory communication with the solvers, the Python packages Pyomo, GEKKO and PuLP lack parallelized, low-level operations and communicate slower with the solver via intermediate files written to disk. Further, the Python AMLs do not make use of state-of-the-art data handling packages. In particular, the assignment of coordinates or indexes is often not supported or memory extensive due to use of an object-oriented implementation where every single combination of coordinates is stored separately.

Linopy is an Python AML that tackles these issues together. By introducing an array-based data model for variables and constraints, Linopy makes mathematical programming compatible with Python's advanced data handling packages Numpy [@harrisArrayProgrammingNumPy2020], Pandas [@rebackPandasdevPandasPandas2022] and Xarray [@hoyerXarrayNDLabeled2017].

The approach follows the idea that a variable $x(d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)$ may be defined on an arbitrary number of $K\ge 0$ dimensions, each dimension spanning over a set of $N_i$ discrete coordinates of arbitrary data type (integer, string, date-time, etc.), i.e. $d_i \in \{c_{i,1},...,c_{i,N}\}$. The variable $x(d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)$ is then stored as an array of shape $N_1 \times N_2 \times ... \times N_K$ containing integer labels referencing to the optimization variables used by the solver. Ensuring a correct alignment of coordinates, the variable can be used in linear expression with arithmetic operations with other variables or with `xarray` built-in functions, such as summing over specific dimension or grouping by user-defined labels. Note that if a variable should not be defined on the full set of coordinates given by $\{d_1, d_2, ..., d_K\}$, a boolean mask may be passed to the initialization of variables, indicating where the variable is defined and where not.

The array-based modelling approach does not only lead to more flexibility but also increases the overall performance. The following figure shows the benchmark against two well-established open source AMLs JuMP and Pyomo. Linopy outperforms `Pyomo` in terms of speed and memory-efficiency and outperforms JuMP in memory-efficiency.

Due to a strong alignment to the `Xarray` package, Linopy supports to store the optimization model as a NetCDF file [@rewNetCDFInterfaceScientific1990] which allows users to quickly share optimization problems with others. Using the [Paramiko package](https://paramiko.org), Linopy can send unsolved problems to a server and retrieve the solution after running the optimization remotely, which is particularly helpful if a large computing resources are needed.

Linopy supports a list of well-established solvers, namely

* `GLPK` [@GLPKGNUProject]
* `CBC`[@forrestCoinorCbcRelease2022]
* `HiGHS`[@huangfuParallelizingDualRevised2018]
* `Gurobi` [@GurobiFastestSolver]
* `Xpress` [@FICOXpressSolver]
* `CPLEX`[cplex2009v12]

There are active plans to create an interface to `PIPS-IPM++` [@rehfeldtMassivelyParallelInteriorpoint2022] and the `SCIP` solver [@bestuzhevaSCIPOptimizationSuite]. Further, upcoming features target model scaling as well as the integration of non-linear expressions.

<!-- The core data classes `Variable`, `LinearExpression` and `Constraint`  are subclasses of `xarray`'s `DataArray` and `Dataset` class. These contain n-dimensional arrays with unique labels referencing the optimization variables and coefficients. Hence, variables and constraints  are defined together with a set of dimensions and their corresponding coordinates.
For example, creating a variable $x(d_1, d_2)$ defined on $d_1 \in \{1,...,N\}$ and $d_2 \in \{1,...,M\}$, would only require passing $d_1$ and $d_2$ to the variable initialization, with optional lower and upper bounds $l_x(d_1,d_2)$ and $u_x(d_1,d_2)$ being defined on (a subset of) $\{d_1, d_2\}$. The returned object is an $N \times M$ array of integer labels referencing to the optimization variables used by the solver.

The Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics and Energy System Technology is using Linopy in order to creating an interface to GPU-based solvers. TODO: mention DLR usage
